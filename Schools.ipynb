    "### Project: Analyzing NYC High School Data\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most controversial issues in the U.S. educational system is the efficacy of standardized tests, and whether they're unfair to certain groups. Given our prior knowledge of this topic, investigating the correlations between SAT scores and demographics might be an interesting angle to take. We could correlate SAT scores with factors like race, gender, income, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SAT, or Scholastic Aptitude Test, is an exam that U.S. high school students take before applying to college. Colleges take the test scores into account when deciding who to admit, so it's fairly important to perform well on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The test consists of three sections, each of which has 800 possible points. The combined score is out of 2,400 possible points (while this number has changed a few times, the data set for our project is based on 2,400 total points). Organizations often rank high schools by their average SAT scores. The scores are also considered a measure of overall school district quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "New York City makes its [data on high school SAT scores](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2012-SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4) available online, as well as the [demographics for each high school](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2014-2015-DOE-High-School-Directory/n3p6-zve2). The first few rows of the SAT data look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-content/sat.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, combining both of the data sets won't give us all of the demographic information we want to use. We'll need to supplement our data with other sources to do our full analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same website has several related data sets covering demographic information and test scores. Here are the links to all of the data sets we'll be using:[datasets](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/browse?category=Education)\n",
    "\n",
    "- SAT scores by school - SAT scores for each high school in New York City\n",
    "- School attendance - Attendance information for each school in New York City\n",
    "- Class size - Information on class size for each school\n",
    "- AP test results - Advanced Placement (AP) exam results for each high school (passing an optional AP exam in a particular subject can earn a student college credit in that subject)\n",
    "- Graduation outcomes - The percentage of students who graduated, and other outcome information\n",
    "- Demographics - Demographic information for each school\n",
    "- School survey - Surveys of parents, teachers, and students at each school\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these data sets are interrelated. We'll need to combine them into a single data set before we can find correlations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we move into coding, we'll need to do some background research. A thorough understanding of the data will help us avoid costly mistakes, such as thinking that a column represents something other than what it does. Background research will also give us a better understanding of how to combine and analyze the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we'll want to research:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City)\n",
    "- [The SAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAT)\n",
    "- [Schools in New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_high_schools_in_New_York_City)\n",
    "- [Our data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/browse?category=Education)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can learn a few different things from these resources. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Only high school students take the SAT, so we'll want to focus on high schools.\n",
    "New York City is made up of five boroughs, which are essentially distinct regions.\n",
    "- New York City schools fall within several different school districts, each of which can contains dozens of schools.\n",
    "- Our data sets include several different types of schools. We'll need to clean them so that we can focus on high schools only.\n",
    "- Each school in New York City has a unique code called a <font color=red>__DBN__</font>, or district borough number.\n",
    "- Aggregating data by district will allow us to use the district mapping data to plot district-by-district differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we've done our background research, we're ready to read in the data. For your convenience, we've placed all the data into the schools folder. Here are all of the files in the folder:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ap_2010.csv - Data on AP test results\n",
    "- class_size.csv - Data on class size\n",
    "- demographics.csv - Data on demographics\n",
    "- graduation.csv - Data on graduation outcomes\n",
    "- hs_directory.csv - A directory of high schools\n",
    "- sat_results.csv - Data on SAT scores\n",
    "- survey_all.txt - Data on surveys from all schools\n",
    "- survey_d75.txt - Data on surveys from New York City district 75\n",
    "\n",
    "__survey_all.txt__ and __survey_d75.txt__ are in more complicated formats than the other files. For now, we'll focus on reading in the CSV files only, and then explore them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Read in the data\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll read each file into a pandas dataframe, and then store all of the dataframes in a dictionary. This will give us a convenient way to store them, and a quick way to reference them later on."
